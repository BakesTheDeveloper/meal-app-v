Meal Suggestion App 

This app was made in Android Studio and was coded in the Kotlin language. Found to work best with Android API 26+. 

 

Overview 

This app's entire purpose is to give you times of day and give a meal suggestion based on what you inputted. Given you don't have errors when pressing the suggestion button, everything should run smoothly besides one UI error bug that I'm working on. 

 

Supported Times 

- Morning 

- Mid-morning 

- Afternoon 

- Late-noon 

- Supper
